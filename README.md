# GUI_door_login_system
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built with Python's tkinter library that simulates a simple login system. Users can input their name, password, and a key password to authenticate themselves. The application checks the credentials against a predefined set of passcodes and displays success or error messages accordingly.
